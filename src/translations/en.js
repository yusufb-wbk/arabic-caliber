  // The Experience
  experienceText:
    "Arabic Caliber designs each starlight kit to elevate not only your vehicle, but the way you feel every time you step inside it. A carefully engineered blend of four fiber-optic star sizes transforms your headliner into a deep, realistic night sky, creating an atmosphere of calm, sophistication, and exclusivity. Whether you prefer a subtle ambient glow or a bold celestial statement, you remain in full control.",

  // Craftsmanship & Installation
  craftsmanshipText:
    "Manufactured in the United States and engineered specifically for the Saudi climate, Arabic Caliber starlights use high-grade optical fiber rather than plastic, guaranteeing superior brightness, long-term durability, and complete headliner safety—even under extreme heat. Each kit includes professional, OEM-level installation: our technicians remove the headliner and work from its reverse side, placing microscopic perforations with absolute precision and securing every fiber with heat-resistant adhesive before an overnight cure. The result is a seamless, custom star-mapped ceiling that feels as refined as it looks.",
